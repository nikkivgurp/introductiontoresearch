## General information
This research is about the amount of swear words in Dutch tweets. I want to find out if that amount has increased or decreased over the last ten years.

## Background information
Cursing has increased on English Twitter (Wenbo Wang, Lu Chen, Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan, and Amit P. Sheth. 2014. Cursing in English on twitter. In Proceedings of the 17th ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work & social computing (CSCW '14). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 415–425. https://doi.org/10.1145/2531602.2531734)
Tweets that include swear words are more likely to be deleted later (Petrovic, Sasa & Osborne, Miles & Lavrenko, Victor. (2013). I Wish I Didn't Say That! Analyzing and Predicting Deleted Messages in Twitter.)

## Research question and hypothesis
My research question is: has the use of swear words in Dutch Tweets in the last ten years increased? My hypothesis is that the amount of swear words has increased, as the amount of swear words in English Tweets has increased and I think those languages will behave the same.

## Method
The method I want to use is to search for the 3 most commonly used swear words in the Twitter corpus. After that, I want to compare the words that I found with each other. On the same day each year, I’m going to check how many times the words I found, occur in the corpus. This way, I can see if the use of swear words has increased or not. If the words behave the same way, I think I can predict something about other swear words. My dependent variable is the amount of swear words on the day I chose in each year and my independent variable is the measure of Dutch swear words in Dutch Tweets.
